It looks like orte_init failed for some reason; your parallel process is
likely to abort.  There are many reasons that a parallel process can
fail during orte_init; some of which are due to configuration or
environment problems.  This failure appears to be an internal failure;
here's some additional information (which may only be relevant to an
Open MPI developer):

  PMI2_Job_GetId failed failed
  --> Returned value (null) (14) instead of ORTE_SUCCESS

srun: error: c25b-s7: task 0: Exited with exit code 1

*** An error occurred in MPI_Init

[c25b-s7.ufhpc:24129] Local abort before MPI_INIT completed successfully; not able to aggregate error messages, and not able to guarantee that all other processes were killed!
Done.
